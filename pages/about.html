                Hi, I’m Darkside, an 18-year-old self-taught programmer with a passion for coding and game development. I began my programming journey at the age of 7 and have since developed a strong expertise in C#, which is my main programming language. Along the way, I also picked up skills in Java, C++, C, and Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I’m an avid gamer. Some of my favorite games include Destiny 2, Minecraft, Call of Duty, and story-driven games like Life is Strange. My love for gaming led me to game development, and I also create mods for games like Minecraft. I’m always working on new projects, and I’m excited to share them with the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy combining my passion for programming and gaming to create unique experiences. Whether it’s building mods or developing new games, I’m always looking for the next challenge. Thanks for stopping by to learn a bit more about me!
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to programming and gaming, I’m also a huge fan of metal music. Some of my favorite bands include Motionless in White, Ice Nine Kills, and Lamb of God.
